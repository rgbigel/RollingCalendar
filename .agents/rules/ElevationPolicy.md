## 1. Rule Overview & Core Invariants

Certain solution components (such as disk/volume inspectors, boot configuration tools, driver managers, and background service setters) require Windows Administrator privileges to access low-level operating system APIs (e.g. `bcdedit`, `fltmc`, `fsutil`, `Get-Partition`, `DiskPart`).

To maintain predictability, prevent hanging automated runners, and enforce documentation-to-code consistency across the workspace, the following rules are mandatory:

## 2. Normative Elevation Rules

### `RULE-ELEV-001` (Mandatory Elevation Metadata)
Every repository governed under LCM `MUST` declare an explicit `execution_context` block inside its `.lcm/config.json`:
```json
"execution_context": {
  "elevation_required": true,
  "minimum_privilege": "Administrator",
  "reason": "Requires low-level access to bcdedit, fltmc volumes, and storage IOCTLs"
}
```
* If the repository does not require elevation, `elevation_required` `MUST` be set to `false`, `minimum_privilege` to `"User"`, and `reason` to `"Standard user execution"`.

### `RULE-ELEV-002` (Guarded Self-Elevation in Source Code)
Any script within `src/` or `Source/` that implements interactive self-elevation (`Start-Process pwsh -Verb RunAs`) `MUST` guard the elevation call with non-interactive detection:
1. `MUST` check whether the environment is interactive (`[Environment]::UserInteractive` and presence of console UI).
2. `MUST` support an explicit `-NoElevation` or `-ForceInProcess` switch to suppress UAC popups during automated test execution.
3. `MUST NOT` block headless CI/CD agents, IDE test adapters, or background runners on modal GUI UAC prompts.

### `RULE-ELEV-003` (Privileged Code Declaration & Anti-Drift)
Any code in `src/` or `Source/` utilizing privileged Windows commands (`bcdedit`, `fltmc`, `fsutil`, `Get-Partition`, `DiskPart`, `Add-BitLockerKeyProtector`, or `Verb RunAs`) `MUST` have `elevation_required: true` declared in `.lcm/config.json`.
* The quality gate `Assert-RepoElevationConsistency` `MUST` fail if undeclared privileged code is detected in a repository configured with `elevation_required: false`.

### `RULE-ELEV-004` (Automated Elevated Test Runner)
Every repository with `elevation_required: true` `MUST` provide a standardized elevated test runner (`tools/Invoke-ElevatedTest.ps1`):
1. Automatically executes Pester tests in-process when the current session is already elevated.
2. When called from a standard user session, dispatches an elevated worker process (`Start-Process -Verb RunAs`), captures the test run, and writes structured JSON test evidence (`out/test_results.json`).
3. Quality gates `MUST` certify test passage based on the generated test evidence.

### `RULE-ELEV-005` (Elevated Console Non-Auto-Close Invariant)
When an interactive script or launcher delegates execution to an elevated console window (`Start-Process pwsh.exe ... -Verb RunAs` or `cmd.exe ... -Verb RunAs`), the spawned elevated window `MUST NOT` automatically close upon script completion.
1. The process invocation `MUST` include `-NoExit` (for `pwsh.exe`) or `/k` (for `cmd.exe`), or terminate with an explicit interactive completion prompt (`Read-Host "Press Enter to exit..."`).
2. This guarantees the operator can inspect output logs, execution summaries, and error diagnostics directly in the elevated terminal without premature window dismissal.
3. **Caller & Worker Notification Standard**:
   - The delegating caller (elevator) `MUST` explicitly display a structured pre-launch banner in the active terminal containing:
     - **Timestamp**: Current system timestamp (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`).
     - **Launch Method**: e.g. `Windows UAC Interactive Elevation (Start-Process -Verb RunAs)`.
     - **Target Script & Arguments**: Full executable/script path and parameters forwarded.
     - **Audit Log Path**: Destination log file where live execution telemetry is recorded.
     - **Window Mode Notice**: Clear indication that the elevated console will remain open upon completion per `RULE-ELEV-005`.
   - The elevated worker `MUST` output a clear completion notice upon finishing indicating that the window has been intentionally kept open for operator inspection.

### `RULE-ELEV-006` (Automated Privilege-Aware Tool Execution & Elevation Interception)
Ensure that any tool, script, or shorthand command requiring administrative privileges is never executed directly within a standard un-elevated user context. Instead, enforce automatic discovery and routing through the standardized CLI interceptor (`.lcm/tools/internal/Invoke-PrivilegedTool.ps1`), the background desktop daemon (`http://127.0.0.1:9876/execute`), or `Invoke-InteractiveDesktop.ps1`.

Before executing any tool, script, or shorthand command, the AI agent or CLI launcher `MUST` perform the following validation sequence:
1. **Catalog & Schema Lookup**:
   - Query the authoritative tool catalog (`.lcm/config/tool_catalog.json` / `WorkspaceInventory`) to resolve the target tool's metadata record.
   - Inspect whether the execution profile defines `"Admin": true` (or equivalent elevation requirement flag).
2. **Context & Privilege Verification**:
   - Check whether the current runtime shell session holds elevated administrative rights (e.g. `([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)`).
3. **Execution Routing & Interception**:
   - **Standard Execution**: If the tool does **not** require admin rights (`"Admin": false` or unset), execute it directly in the current session.
   - **Elevated Interception**: If `"Admin": true` and the current session is running under a standard un-elevated user context, **do not** execute the script directly in that session. Immediately route the call via:
     ```powershell
     pwsh .lcm/tools/internal/Invoke-PrivilegedTool.ps1 -Tool <ToolName> [-Arguments <Args>] [-NoExit]
     ```
   - **Automated Dispatch Pipeline**: `Invoke-PrivilegedTool.ps1` and generated `.cmd` trampolines inspect the Session 1 Desktop Daemon on port 9876 and dispatch via `POST /execute` (`{ "command": "...", "elevated": true, "noExit": true }`), falling back to `Invoke-InteractiveDesktop.ps1 -Elevated` if the daemon is offline. Console windows launched via elevation `MUST` include `-NoExit` / `/k` per `RULE-ELEV-005`.
