# File: PowerShellRules.md

Module: PowerShellRules
Purpose: Authoritative rules for PowerShell script generation and normalization.
Path: .agents/rules/PowerShellRules.md
Authors: Rolf
Version: 8.7.0
Changelog:
- 2026-09-27: Added inline-single-quotes invariant and colon-safe-interpolation rule to eliminate host shell pre-expansion and parsing errors.
- 2026-09-26: Standardized on PS7 (pwsh) runtime exclusively; parity for intermediate code.
- 2026-07-27: Split unified rule file; clarified ASCII constraints; stabilized PS rules.

POWERSHELL-RULES
- ps7-exclusive: pwsh (PS7) is mandatory workspace-wide; legacy powershell.exe (5.1) is forbidden
- intermediate-parity: rules apply equally to permanent scripts and inline pwsh -Command blocks
- inline-single-quotes: inline pwsh -Command blocks MUST use single-quoted script blocks '& { ... }' or here-strings to prevent outer shell variable pre-expansion ($var)
- colon-safe-interpolation: variables followed by colons MUST use explicit braces (${var}:)
- ascii-default: ASCII required; umlauts allowed in literal strings and comments
- utf8-without-bom: scripts must be UTF-8 without BOM
- newline-crlf: scripts must end with CRLF
- no-backticks: forbidden
- no-interpolated-calls: forbid method calls inside interpolated strings
- assign-$_-first: always assign $_ to a variable before use
- no-non-ascii-identifiers: identifiers must be ASCII-only
- no-hidden-state: forbid hidden pipeline or implicit variable usage
- deterministic-output: identical input → identical output
