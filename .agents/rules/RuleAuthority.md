## 1. Governance Authority Invariants

### `RULE-AUTH-001` (Single Source of Truth & Zero Rule Forking)
- **Canonical Physical Hub**: `Workspace_AI\.agents\rules\` is the single, authoritative physical host and primary commit gate for all LCM governance rules.
- **Root & Child Discovery**: The root workspace container links `D:\Git_Repositories\.agents\rules\` directly to `Workspace_AI\.agents\rules\` via NTFS directory junction (`mklink /J`), avoiding rule commit churn on the root container. All governed child repositories link their local `.agents\rules` directory to this canonical hub.
- **No Independent Truth**: Child repositories and IDE adapter surfaces `MUST NOT` fork, maintain conflicting local copies, or override core governance policies without an approved Change Request.

### `RULE-AUTH-002` (Mandatory Rule Matrix Synchronization Invariant)
Whenever an existing rule is updated, or a new rule/policy is created ("invented"), the author or AI agent `MUST` update all discovery entrypoints in the same change set:
1. **Root Quick-Reference Table**: Update [`AGENTS.md`](file:///d:/Git_Repositories/AGENTS.md) with the new rule name, rule codes (`RULE-*`), domain, scope, and key invariant.
2. **Comprehensive Matrix**: Update [`Workspace_AI/docs/LCM-Rules-Cross-Reference.md`](file:///d:/Git_Repositories/Workspace_AI/docs/LCM-Rules-Cross-Reference.md) with the full metadata, enforcing scripts, and quality gate mappings.
3. **Child Junction Verification**: Verify that the newly created rule is immediately visible across all child repository `.agents\rules` junctions.

## 2. Activation Commands
- `@RULEAUTH`: Activates and validates the canonical source-of-truth and synchronization policy.
